          <p>
            My name's Alan and I'm a photogtapher and photo retoucher based in
            Kerry, Ireland. Headshot photography is my passion and I love having
            the opportunity to capture a moment when someone is being their true
            self.
          </p>
          <p>
            The key to getting a good headshot photo, is being able to make your 
            subject feel relaxed and at ease. After years of practice, I have 
            developed a style that allows people to be themselves when in front 
            of my camera.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also love to edit photos. I do this using photoshop to retouch 
            photos which is similar to dodging and burning that used to be 
            done for many years in dark rooms of photography studios. With 
            photoshop, I have a lot more tools to help me bring the best out 
            of photographs.
